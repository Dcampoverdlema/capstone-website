    "text": "In 2022, 46.8 million Americans who were twelve years of age or older struggled with a drug use disorder. Eight million Americans aged twelve and older battled alcohol and drug use issues at the same time that year. Use of drugs and alcohol has substantial financial consequences. Every year, excessive alcohol use costs 249 billion dollars in lost productivity, medical expenditures, and criminal justice costs. In contrast, illicit drug usage costs 193 billion dollars in lost productivity, criminality, and medical costs. Communities can benefit from adopting and putting into practice policies that lessen prescription drug abuse and excessive alcohol consumption.\nFrom this information, the question we are going to answer, is there demographic and social factors that are predictors of drug overdose and alcohol-related incidents (e.g., driving accidents)?\nOur hypothesis we came to is, the chances of drug overdoses and alcohol-related driving incidents can be predicted by demographic factors like age, gender, and race as well as social factors like substance use habits and socioeconomic status.\nCertain demographic variables—like age, gender, and race—have a major impact on the risk of drug overdoses and incidents involving alcohol and driving. For example, middle-aged people may be at risk from long-term substance use, while younger people may be at risk from peer pressure and experimentation. Another important factor is gender: it’s possible that men experience higher rates of substance abuse and related incidents than women do, possibly as a result of differing social behaviors and stress reactions. Differences in socioeconomic status, community support, and access to healthcare can all contribute to racial disparities. Social factors hold equal significance. Substance use patterns, such as the kind and quantity of drugs or alcohol consumed, are strong indicators of incidents linked to substance use. Furthermore, access to treatment or preventive resources, as well as patterns of substance use, can be influenced by socioeconomic status, which includes factors like education, work status, and income level. Tailored interventions can be devised through the identification and comprehension of these demographic and social variables. By customizing these interventions to target particular high-risk populations, their effectiveness can be increased and the population’s overall rate of drug overdoses and alcohol-related driving accidents can be decreased."

    "text": "Ways to Reduce Unemployment\nCareer pathways programs: Programs for career pathways provide low-skilled people with occupation-specific training for higher-skilled roles in rapidly expanding industries including information technology, advanced manufacturing, and health care. These programs integrate social services with academic and technical education; many also include work experience (“Building Strong Middle-Class Career Pathways Programs”).\nSummer youth employment programs: Summer youth employment programs give young people, often between the ages of 14 and 24, temporary jobs. Program organizers typically provide financial support for positions, and programs are managed by nonprofits or government organizations. Private sector businesses, on the other hand, could offer more competitive placements and pay participants directly. Programs may incorporate extra supports, such a work-readiness curriculum, and typically center on giving underprivileged youngsters options (“Youth Employment Programs”).\nProviding a generous tax credit for companies: This will incentivize job creation by reducing the financial burden of hiring additional workers. This encourages businesses to expand their workforce, thereby reducing overall unemployment rates (Lerman)."

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nSince we are working with county level data, all individuals’ data in a county are simply averaged which might mask important granular differences within counties. This could be an issue especially for larger counties that have multiple urban and rural areas and are therefore more socioeconomically and demographically diverse. For example, Los Angeles County is huge (population-wise) with 88 cities and nearly as many unincorporated areas. All these areas have vastly different socioeconomic conditions, access to healthcare, education levels, and employment opportunities. Aggregating by county masks these differences and makes it hard to generalize our findings. Additionally, drug overdose rates could vary by state depending on how strict the regulations are on drugs accessibility.\nAs the dataset had a lot of missing data on drug overdose deaths, we had to reduce our dataset from 3000 to 1000 observations. This increases variability in the data, leading to less precise parameter estimates."
